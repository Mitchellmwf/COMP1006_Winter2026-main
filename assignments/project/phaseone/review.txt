I did get bump into a few hurdles here and there, but nothing needing more than searching lesson files or google. One Thing I could have done is use JS for the form that lets you switch between display and create.

Something I'd like to try next time is having the webapp that can see, create, and edit DBs, tables, columns. With what we've learned in relational DBs, I imagine it would be quite doable.
